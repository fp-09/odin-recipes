        <P>This sweet and sour pork recipe is from my husband's grandmother, who was Chinese. She taught me how to make this recipe â€” it's the way Gramma made sweet and sour dishes her whole life until she died at age 94. The secret is apple cider vinegar.</P>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound pork butt, cut into 1 inch cubes/li>
                <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>

            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place cubed pork in a medium bowl and season with soy sauce, salt, and sugar for marinade. Add egg white and green onions and mix until well-combined. Cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 quart oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan or deep fryer.</li>
